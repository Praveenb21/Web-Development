    <hr>
    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
        by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed
        by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, 
        the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated 
        March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly 
        after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team,
        the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron 
        Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published 
        consistently since the character's creation.</p>

    <h2>Publication History</h2><hr>
    <h3><b>Creation</b></h3>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
        revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics 
        created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept
        for Iron Man.[1] He wanted to design a character who should be 
        unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the 
        character anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent 
        arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated 
        into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active 
        player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam 
        during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that 
        the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".</p><hr>
    <h2>Characterization</h2><hr>
    <h3><b>Fictional character biography</b></h3>
    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. 
        As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, 
        when his parents were killed in a car crash.[89] Developing equipment 
        for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test
        when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by 
        shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. </p><hr>
